<h3>
<span>WADY MOKATTEB IDENTIFIED WITH KIBROTH HATTAVAH.</span>
</h3>


<p>The difficulty of deciding the antiquity of the famous inscriptions in
the deserts of Arabia, would be considerably diminished if we could
ascertain the earliest mention of the valley now known as Wady Mokatteb.
What I am about to submit to the readers of the
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>", is
not a presumptuous or rash suggestion, but an idea diffidently
entertained, and cautiously and maturely considered.</p>

<p>It is not at all improbable that that valley, with its surrounding rocky
chronicles, was first mentioned by Moses, the first delineator of the
"great wilderness." The mention I allude to is to be found in Numbers,
xi. 26. The passage, as it occurs in the English version, runs thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of
    the one was Eldad, and the name of the other was Medad; and
    the Spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were
    written."</p>

<p class="noindent">The original words of the last clause are but the two following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="larger" title='Hebrew: vhêmâh bakkthûwbîym'>&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;
 &#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> </p>

<p class="noindent">which literally signify, "and they were amongst the inscriptions."</p>

<p>A personal and literary examination of the locality of the Sinaitic
inscriptions convinces me that Eldad and Medad were then in that famous
region. By a reference to the chapter alluded to, it will be found that
the children of Israel were then at that awfully memorable place called
<i>Kibroth Hattavah</i> (ver. 34.), and no one, who has but a slight
knowledge of scripture topography, will be at a loss to observe that it
is the very spot where the mysterious inscriptions are found.</p>

<p>Dr. Robinson, in his <i>Biblical Researches</i>, vol. i. p. 138., thus
notices the subject in question:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The Sinaite inscriptions are found on all the routes which
    lead from the West towards Sinai, above the convent
    El-Arbain, but are found neither on Gebel Mûsa, nor on the
    present Horeb, nor on St. Catherine, nor in the valley of the
    convent; while on Serbal they are seen on its very summit."</p>

<p>Lord Lindsay, in his first letter from <i>Edom and the Holy Land</i>,
introduces the same district in the following words:</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "We now entered Wady Mokatteb, a spacious valley, bounded on
    the east by a most picturesque range of black mountains, but
    chiefly famous for the inscriptions on the rocks that line
    it, and from which it derives its name. There are thousands
    of them, inscriptions too, and here is the mystery, in a
    character which no one has yet deciphered."</p>

<p>Now, let the ancient and modern maps be compared, and it will be
discovered that the same place which is called, in Num. xi. 26.,
<span class="larger" title='Hebrew: kthûwbîym'>&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,
  probably on account of its inscriptions, is also called by
the Arabians <span class="larger" title='Arabic: wadi el mokatteb'>&#1608;&#1575;&#1583;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1603;&#1578;&#1617;&#1576;</span>
 <i>Wady el Mokatteb</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span></p>

<p>Should the identity between Wady Mokatteb and Kibroth Hattavah be
considered conclusive, then the antiquity of the Sinaitic inscriptions
is far more remote than the date fixed by certain archæologists and
palæographists; the records may prove to be, in truth and in deed, the
handy-work of the Israelites during their encampment there.</p>

<p>The readers of the
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"  need scarcely be told that the
inscriptions were first noticed in the sixth century by Cosmas, a
Græco-Indian merchant, who was hence surnamed Indicopleustes. But it is
necessary to impress the fact that Cosmas, though a man of intelligence
and of letters, considered that the alphabet in which the inscriptions
were made, was unknown; but having visited the Wady in company with
certain well-informed Jews, his Hebrew companions read and deciphered
several of the records, and decided that the Israelites of the Egyptian
Exodus were the performers of the inscriptions. All this Cosmas stated
in his <i>Christian Topography</i> (a work published for the first time in
1707 by the learned Montfauçon), and concurs in the opinion that the
ancient Hebrews were the scribes. This circumstance borne in mind, will
be proof against the theory conceived by Professor Beer, brought forth
by Dr. Lepsius, adopted and fostered by Dr. Wilson, viz. that an Utopian
Nabathæan Christian tribe executed those inscriptions during their
pilgrimages to the sacred localities on Mount Sinai. Is it not strange
that Cosmas should not have heard that there was such a tribe of scribes
in the valley? Is it not unaccountable that the knowledge of the
alphabet should so soon have been forgotten? Cosmas flourished
comparatively but a short time after the supposed Nabathæans.</p>

<p>But the advocates of the Nabathæan theory argue that the Sinaitic
inscriptions must be of a comparatively modern date, since there are
found amongst them some Greek and Latin ones; and, moreover, the cross
does sometimes occur in various shapes. I venture to submit that the
inscriptions bear self-evidence that they have been executed at various
dates. It is true that by far the greatest number of them display
indubitable marks of remote antiquity; but there are some which must be
pronounced juvenile when compared with the <i>great majority</i>. The latter
bear marks of an execution resembling the inscriptions on the ancient
Egyptian obelisks, whilst the former are rude and superficially cut, and
already almost effaced. I take, therefore, the Greek and Latin, and
indeed some of the yet unknown inscriptions, to have been cut at a
comparatively modern date. Who knows whether Cosmas and his companions
did not try their hands at a few?</p>

<p>Why should it be thought improbable that the different monks on Mount
Sinai, who occupied the convent there at various ages, should have done
their quota to puzzle the modern palæographist and traveller? Is it
absolutely impossible that the prefect of the Franciscan missionaries of
Egypt, who visited the Wady in 1722, and his companions, who were well
instructed in the Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Coptic, Latin,
Armenian, Turkish, English, Illyrian, German, and Bohemian languages,
should have chiselled a few in the characters they were most expert? In
the same manner might the occurrence of the cross be accounted for, if
it were necessary, without precipitating oneself to the conclusion that
"the occurrence, in connection with the inscriptions of the cross in
various forms, indicates that their <i>origin</i> should be attributed to the
early Christians." But is it possible that such antiquaries as Drs.
Beer, Lepsius, and Wilson, should be ignorant, or affect to be ignorant,
that the cross was an ancient hieroglyphic, of a date long before the
Christian era, well known by the name of <i>Crux Ansata</i>, and of the
<i>Divina Taw</i>, and signified among the Egyptians "Life to come"? That the
form of the cross was used among the Hebrews is conclusive from the fact
that it was the ancient Hebrew mint letter for the
 <span class="larger" title='Hebrew: tav'>&#1514;</span>.
What, then, is the value of the arguments in behalf of the Nabathæan
theory? All the specimens that have been given hitherto of the
inscriptions, are no more in comparison with the vast numbers which
literally cover the highest mountains, than a drop out of a bucket,
including even those given in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of 1766,
in the <i>Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature</i> of 1832, and by
the Rev. Charles Forster of this <a id="year1"></a>year <a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, and even adding the 1200 taken
by M. Lottin de Laval. (See
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>", Vol. iv., p. 332.)</p>

<h3>
<span>ON A PASSAGE IN GOLDSMITH.</span>
</h3>


<p>Goldsmith, in <i>The Deserted Village</i>, has the lines:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</p>
      <p>Where wealth accumulates and men decay:</p>
      <p>Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,</p>
      <p><i>A breath can make them, as a breath has made</i>;</p>
      <p>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</p>
      <p>When once destroy'd, can never be supplied."</p>

</div>

<p>In this passage the fourth line, which I have given in italics, is
traced by D'Israeli, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span> <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, under the
head of "Imitations and Similarities," to the French poet, De Caux, who,
comparing the world to his hour-glass, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

       <p class="i11">&mdash;&mdash;"C'est une verre qui luit,</p>
      <p>Qu'un souffle peut <i>détruire</i>, et qu'un souffle a <i>produit</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>The turn given to the thought in the French has suggested to D'Israeli
an emendation of the passage in Goldsmith. He proposes that the word
"unmakes" should be substituted for "can make." The line would then
read&mdash;</p>

   <div class="poem">

  <p>"A breath <i>unmakes</i> them, as a breath has made."</p>

</div>

<p>This emendation seems to me to be alike ingenious and well-founded. The
line itself is but the corollary of the one that precedes it; and in
order to make the sense complete, it should contain antithetical
expressions to correspond with "flourish" and "fade." Now, between "can
make" and "made" there is nothing antithetical; but between "made" and
"unmakes" there is.</p>

<p>In support of this view, I may quote one or two parallel passages, in
which the antithesis is preserved. The first is a quatrain commemorating
the devastating effects of an earthquake in the valley of Lucerne in
1808:</p>

<div class="poem">

 <p> "O ciel! ainsi ta Providence</p>
        <p class="i1">A tous les maux nous condamna:</p>
 <p>Un souffle <i>éteint</i> notre existence</p>
        <p class="i1">Comme un souffle nous la <i>donna</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>The second is a line which occurs in <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, and
which I am compelled to quote from memory, having no access to that
work. It is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"A breath <i>revived</i> him, but a breath <i>o'erthrew</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>That Goldsmith wrote the line in question with the word "unmakes," there
seems little reason to doubt. To say of princes and lords that "a breath
can make them, as a breath has made," far from conveying any idea of
their "fading," would be, on the contrary, to indicate the facile
process by which they may be perpetuated. It would show how they may
"flourish," but not how they may "fade."</p>

<p>Although this emendation in Goldsmith was pointed out many years ago,
and recommends itself by its appositeness, and its obvious adaptation to
the context, yet I believe it has never been introduced into any edition
of that poet. I have before me two copies of <i>The Deserted Village</i>, and
both contain the words "can make." As, however, among the many useful
hints thrown out by
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>", that of suggesting the
emendation of obscure or difficult passages in our poets, appears to
have met with the approbation of your readers, I trust some future
editor of Goldsmith may be induced to notice this passage, and restore
the text to its original accuracy.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Word Premises.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The use of the word <i>premises</i> for houses, lands,
and hereditaments, is surely incorrect. I have never found the word
<i>præmissa</i> used in any Latin writer in a sense that can sanction the
modern application of its derivative. Johnson's authority supports the
view that the word is perverted in being made to stand for houses and
lands, as he says it is "in low language" that the noun substantive
"premises" is used in that sense, as, "I was upon the <i>premises</i>," &amp;c.
The office of "the premises" in a deed, say the Law Dictionaries, is to
express the names of the grantor and grantee, and to specify the thing
granted. "The <i>premises</i> is the former part of a deed, being all that
which precedeth the <i>habendum</i> or limitation of the estate." I believe
the term "parcels" is applied, technically, to the specification of the
property which forms the subject of a deed. In an instrument, it may not
be wholly incorrect to refer by the term "premises" to the particulars
premised, and, if an etymological inaccuracy, it may be excused for the
sake of avoiding repetitions; but surely we ought not to speak of
houses, lands, &amp;c. by this term. I see I am not the first to call an
editor's attention to this point, for, in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> of
Jan., 1795, a correspondent complains of this improper application of
the word, and attributes the perversion to the lawyers, "who," he says,
"for the sake of brevity (to which, by-the-bye, they are not much
attached), have accustomed themselves to the phrase, 'the aforesaid
<i>premises</i>,' whence the word has come to be universally taken as a
collective noun, signifying manors, tenements, and so on." The absurdity
of such a use of the word is illustrated by putting it for animals,
household goods, and personal estate, for which it may as well stand as
for lands and houses.</p>

<h3>
<span>DEODANDS AND THEIR APPLICATION.</span>
</h3>

<p>Blackstone states (1 <i>Comm.</i> p. 300.) that a deodand&mdash;</p>

    <p class="blockquot">"Is forfeited to the king to be applied to pious uses, and
    distributed in alms by his high almoner, though formerly
    destined to a more superstitious purpose. It seems to have
    been originally designed, in the blind days of Popery, as an
    expiation for the souls of such as were snatched away by
    sudden death; and for that purpose ought properly to have
    been given to holy church."</p>

<p>The authorities for this latter statement are Fitzh., <i>Abr.</i>, tit.
"Enditement," pt. 27., and Staunf., <i>P.C.</i>, 20, 21., neither of which
books are in my possession, nor in this remote district can I gain
access to them. Hume, Lingard, Henry, and Rapin, omit all mention of
this change in the destination of the deodand, at least so far as I can
find. Fleta, who lived, according to Dr. Cowell (<i>Interpreter</i>, in verb.
"Fleta"), tem. Ed. II., Ed. III., or, according to Jacob (<i>Law Dic.</i>, in
ver. "Fleta"), tem. Ed. I., says that&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "This deodand is to be sold to the poor, and the price
    distributed to the poor for the soul of the king and all
    faithful people departed this life."&mdash;<i>Interpreter</i>, in ver.
    "Deodand."</p>

<p>It would therefore appear that in Fleta's time it was settled law that
deodands went to the Crown; nor does this writer seem to take any notice
of their having been, at any time, payable to the Church. Hawkins, East,
and I think Hale also, are equally silent upon the point.</p>

<p>Can any of your readers kindly supply the information as to when
deodands first ceased to be given to the Church, and when they became
the property of the Crown?</p>

<span>349. <i>Hell Paved with the Skulls of Priests.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The proverb "Hell is
paved with good intentions" (Vol. ii. pp. 86. 140.), brings to my
recollection a remark I once heard from the lips of a French priest. He
was addressing an audience chiefly composed of students in divinity, and
while descanting on the peculiar dangers to which ecclesiastics are
exposed, and the obstacles they have to encounter at every step on the
road to salvation, he said there could be no doubt that by far the
greater number of them would incur eternal damnation. "It was this"
(added he, with an emphasis which sent thrill of horror through all
present), "It was this that made one of the early fathers assert, that
Hell is paved with the skulls of priests." I think the preacher
mentioned Tertullian as his authority for this singular sentiment, but
he only gave the words: "L'enfer est pavé de têtes de prêtres." Can any
of your readers point out the precise passage referred to?</p>

<h3>
<span>THE CRUCIFIX AS USED BY THE EARLY CHRISTIANS.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 422.).</span>
</h3>


<p>A correspondent questions the accuracy of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>
C<span class="smcap lowercase">URZON'S</span> statement, in his
<i>Monasteries of the Levant</i>, that&mdash;</p>

    <p class="blockquot">"The crucifix was not known before the fifth or sixth
    century, though the cross was always the emblem of the
    Christian  faith,"&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and asks for information as to its use, and the dates of the earliest
examples. Some twenty years ago I devoted some care to this inquiry, and
the result will be found in a chapter on the decline of the arts in
Greece, in a <i>History of Modern Greece</i>, which I published in 1830. To
that essay, but more especially to the authorities which it cites, I
would refer your correspondent; and I think, after an examination of the
latter, he will be disposed to concur with me, that Mr. Curzon's
statement is correct. It is in accordance with that of Gibbon, and
sustained by the same authorities as Basnage, to the effect that the
first Christians, from their association with the Jews, and their
aversion to the mythology of the Greeks, were hostile to the use of
images of any description in their primitive temples, in which they
reluctantly admitted the figure of the ignominious cross, as a memorial
of the Redeemer's death. At a later period, however, the veneration for
the <i>relics</i> of departed saints led to the admission of their painted
<i>portraits</i>, and eventually to the erection of their images and effigies
in wood and marble. (<i>Gibbon</i>, chap. xxiii. xlix.) Reiskius states that
it was not till the fourth century after Christ that the latter
innovation began:</p>

    <p class="blockquot">"Ecclesia vero Christiana tribus seculis prioribus ne quidem
    imagines recepit aut inter sacra numeravit instrumenta. Sed
    demum sub finem quarti seculi ea lege admisit ut in templis
    memoriæ ac ornatus causa haberentur."&mdash;Reiskius, <i>De
    Imaginibus Jesu Christi Exercitationes Histor.</i>, ex. i. c. i.
    sec. ii. p. 12.</p>

<p>Lillio Giraldi concurs with Reiskius:</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "Illud certe non prætermittam nos dico Christianos ut
    aliquando Romanos fuisse sine imaginibus in primitiva quæ
    vocatur ecclesia."&mdash;Lillius Gregorius Giraldus, <i>Historiæ
    Deorum Syntage</i>, v. i. p. 15.</p>

<p>The earliest images of Christ were those mentioned as being placed, by
Alexander Severus, along with those of Abraham, Jupiter, Pythagoras,
Plato, and Aristotle. (<i>Reiskius</i>, ex. vii. c. i. sec. i. p. 151.)
Constantine placed two equestrian statues of the Saviour in the Lateran
Church. But Molanus, who mentions the latter fact, insists that there
were existing about this period numerous statues of the Saviour, which
he would refer to the time of Pontius Pilate. (<i>De Historia SS.
Imaginibus, &amp;c.</i>, lib. i. c. vi. p. 65.)</p>

<p>The most ancient examples now remaining of the decorations employed by
the early Christians, are doubtless those found in the catacombs at
Rome. I have not access to any recent copies of these interesting
antiquities; but so far as my recollection serves, they contain no
example of a crucifix, or any literal delineation of the death of the
Saviour. In fact, even in these gloomy retreats, the vigilance of
persecution compelled the Christians to caution, and forced them to
conceal, under allegories and mystery, the memorials of their faith; the
figure of the Redeemer being always veiled under an assumed character,
most generally that of a shepherd bearing in his arms a recovered lamb.
This, which is the most common form of allegory of this period, occurs
in the catacomb of the Via Latina, in that of Priscilla in the Via
Salaria, discovered in 1776, both of which, according to Aringhi, are
amongst the oldest Christian monuments now remaining. (<i>Roma
Subterranea</i>, vol. ii. p. 25. 292.) In a sepulchral chamber in the
cemetery of St. Calixtus, Jesus is represented as Orpheus with a lyre,
as emblematic of the subduing influences of his life. But his death is
still more cautiously shadowed forth by the types of Jonas, Isaac on the
altar of Abraham, and Daniel in the den of lions,&mdash;examples of all of
which are numerous; and the cover of an urn figured by Agincourt
presents them all three. (<i>Histoire de l'Art par les Monumens</i>, vol.
iv.; <i>Dec. Sculp.</i>, pl. v. no. 10.)</p>

<p>Art, after its decline in Rome, was later cherished by the Greeks at
Byzantum, and allegory in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span> hands, during the third and
fourth centuries, exhibited a much higher refinement than amongst the
degenerate Romans,&mdash;the divinity and <i>life</i> of Jesus being represented
in their paintings by a youth of godlike mien and heavenly grace, with
his foot upon the mane of a lion, whilst his <i>death</i> is still typified
by a lamb expiring at the foot of a cross, which it sprinkles with its
blood, and his <i>resurrection</i> by a ph&oelig;nix, which rests upon the
summit of a palm-tree, the emblem of his <i>victory</i>.</p>

<p>I have stated that even the <i>cross</i>, as an emblem, was admitted
"reluctantly" into the churches of the early Christians. The fact, and
the causes of this reluctance, are stated fairly by Gibbon (ch. xx.),
principally on the authorities consulted by Basnage in his <i>Histoire des
Eglises Reformées</i>, to have had their origin in the idea of infamy and
ignominy which they attached to the mode of execution by
crucifixion,&mdash;feelings analogous to those inspired by a gallows or a
gibbet; and it required a long lapse of time, even after Constantine had
abolished throughout the Roman dominions the punishment which had
prevailed for slaves and malefactors, but which the Saviour of mankind
had submitted to suffer, before the people could be led to regard as a
symbol for veneration that which had so long been an object of horror
and disgust. A most interesting account of the subsidence of this
feeling, and of its effects upon Sacred Art whilst it prevailed, will be
found in Emeric David's <i>Discours sur la Peinture Moderne</i>, p. 115. It
rendered allegory so indispensable, that in the exhaustion of fancy it
declined into conceits and puerility, which finally brought the subject
into contempt, and compelled the hierarchy to exert the influence of the
Church for its correction. This led to a measure the record of which is
strongly corroborative of the statement of Mr. Curzon; namely, that <small>A.D.</small>
692, at the Quine Sextine, or <i>Council in Trullo</i>, it was ordered that
thenceforth fiction and allegory should cease, and <i>the real figure of
the Saviour be depicted on the tree</i>. (<i>Can.</i> 82. <i>Act. Concil.</i> Paris,
1714, v. iii. col. 1691, 1692.)</p>

<p>The Greeks complied, but with reluctance, to delineate the actual
crucifixion; and as, in the controversy which arose in the second
century, and never entirely subsided, regarding the beauty or deformity
of the Saviour's features, the Greek Church had espoused the side of St.
Basil, Tertullian, and Origen, who maintained that "he was without form
or comeliness," their artists exhibited such a spectacle of deformity on
the cross, that to the present hour a proverb compares a lean and ugly
person to "un crucifix des Grecs." The Latins and Italians, on the other
hand, whilst they were equally hostile to the literal exhibition of the
Redeemer's death, and <i>forbore for nearly a century</i> to comply with the
orders of the Council <i>in Trullo</i>, adopted, as to his beauty, the party
of Celsus and Chrysostom,&mdash;quoted the expression of David, "thou art
fairer than the children of men,"&mdash;and painted the Saviour, albeit
suspended on the fatal tree, as a youth of heavenly mien; and instead of
the crown of thorns, the lance, and the sponge, they represented him
with a diadem, and insensible to suffering or pain.</p>

<p>These remarks, though they will no doubt be insufficient as an answer to
your correspondent, may perhaps direct him to authorities, the
consultation of which will satisfy his inquiry.</p>

<h3>
<span title="[Greek: Adelphos]">THE WORD &#913;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 339, 458.)</span>
</h3>


<p>In commenting on the criticisms of J. B., may I be allowed to follow the
order of his own reasoning as much as possible?</p>

<p>1st. I am glad to find that Scapula is right, but I must object to the
use of the participle <i>acquiescing</i>, as applied to me. My word is
"<i>de</i>duction," and is applied to a rule grounded upon Scapula's
correctness, and may, I think, settle the sense of those disputed verses
in Matt. xiii. 55, 56, to say nothing of two indisputable proofs which
might be adduced.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>I</i> am wrong&mdash;for what? for <i>appearing</i>, in the eyes of J. B., to
have done that which I have not done,&mdash;for bringing in links of "the
Indo-Germanic languages," which I have neither done, nor can do.</p>

<p>3rd. "The word is solely and peculiarly Greek." Let me give only one
etymon by way of preparation for my answer. Let us take the word
<i>mouse</i>. Well, it comes from the Latin <i>mus</i>, which comes, you will say,
from the Greek <span title="[Greek: mys]">&#956;&#965;&#962;</span>, and there are many clever etymologists,
excepting a few, with J. B. and myself, would say, "it is solely and
peculiarly Greek;" but <i>we</i> go up to the Sanscrit (the <i>mother</i> of
European languages), and bring forward <i>mush</i>, a mouse, and here is <i>the
terminus</i>&mdash;and why? because <i>mush</i> signifies <i>to steal</i>, and therefore
sufficiently describes the nature of the little animal. Now, because we
cannot <i>find</i> an existing link between the Greek and Sanscrit, is that a
reason for asserting <span title="[Greek: adelphos]">&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> to be of pure Greek <i>origin</i>? No;
and if J. B. will only recollect that all words in Sanscrit, excepting
bare primary roots, are compounded after the same manner as <span title="[Greek: adelphos]">&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>
or rather <span title="[Greek: del-ph]">&#948;&#949;&#955;-&#966;</span>, he will, I hope, find that I have
<i>not been wrong</i> in my <i>etymon</i>. Moreover, let J. B. prove, <i>if he can</i>,
what is <i>the meaning</i> of <span title="[Greek: delph]">&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;</span> in the Greek, unaided by any
other language.</p>

<p>4th. Why is the Sanscrit <i>bhratre</i> brought into the contest? perhaps to
prove what has not been proved, viz. that <i>it also</i> signifies <i>frater
uterinus</i>.</p>

<p>5th. "How happened it that the word <span title="[Greek: phratêr]">&#966;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#961;</span>
 was lost in Greek?"
Why, because the Greeks thought it too <i>barbarous</i> a word to <i>own</i>, as
coming through the Latins from the barbarous Goths,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
Scandinavians, &amp;c.! Let us pass over irrelevant matter till we come to</p>

<p>6th. J. B.'s authoritative rule, "that no apparent similarity between
words in the Semitic and Asian (read Sanscrit) families can be used to
establish a real identity, the two classes of language being <i>radically</i>
and fundamentally distinct." Vide <i>mouse</i>, and a hundred more roots,
that might quash this rule.</p>

<p>To conclude, I did not introduce the Sanscrit <i>dal</i> into my former note,
because, I suppose, an idea passed through my mind that I might offend

<span>THE ROMAN INDEX EXPURGATORIUS OF 1607.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 440.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I am happy in being able to give, I trust, a satisfactory answer to the
Query of your American correspondent U. U., respecting the original
edition of 1607.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the copy in the Bodleian Library is of the
genuine edition. It was in the Library certainly before the year 1620,
as it appears in the catalogue printed in that year, and still bears the
same reference on the shelf as is there given to it, namely, 8vo. I. 32.
Theol.; and it was doubtless the copy used by Dr. James, who
superintended the forming of that catalogue, and who died only a few
months before. The title runs thus:</p>

<p>This edition extends to 608 pages, in double columns, besides the
preliminary matter, consisting of four articles, of which the first in
this edition is the last in the genuine copy of 1607,&mdash;a circumstance
mentioned by Clement as peculiar to the Altdorff edition; but here the
signatures run to pages in eights, whereas the Altdorff edition "qu'ne
remplit qu'un alphabet, et seize feuilles."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Hobbes's "Leviathan"</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 314.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The meaning of the
frontispiece to the first edition of this work, is, I imagine,
sufficiently obvious. The large figure representing a commonwealth holds
in his right hand a sword, in his left a pastoral crook. He is the
emblem of a commonwealth "ecclesiastical and civil" (as the title of the
book shows us). Ranged down one side of the page, under the
sword-bearing arm, are the weapons and resources which the State
possesses. Down the other side of the page, under the protection of the
pastoral staff, is the corresponding armament of the Church. Thus, a
castle and a church, a crown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span> and a mitre, a cannon and spiritual
thunderbolts, a trophy of guns and spears, &amp;c., and one of dilemmas
(represented by a pair of bull's horns), syllogisms (made like a
three-pronged fork), and the like; these, ending with a battle on one
side, a convention of bishops on the other, show the power which (as
Hobbes would have it) each arm of the commonwealth should be able to
have at its command. The whole picture is at best an absurd conceit, and
very unworthy of the author of the <i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

     <p class="right">H. A. B.</p>

<p>The best edition of Hobbes's works was printed 1750. The print of
<i>Leviathan</i> in it is neither like Charles nor Cromwell, of whom I have
old and good prints, and many. The print has at the bottom of it
"<i>Written</i> by Thos. Hobbs, 1651."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Age of Trees</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 401.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I am rather surprised that your
correspondent L., in his enumeration of remarkable trees, and
collections of trees, in Great Britain, makes no mention, whilst on the
subject of yew, of the splendid collection of old yew trees in Kingley
Bottom, near Chichester, in Sussex. Should L. never have visited this
charming spot, and its green antiquities, I can promise him a rich treat
whenever he does so. Common report of the neighbourhood, from time
immemorial, gives these venerable trees a date as far back as the
landing of the sea-kings on the coast of Sussex; and sundry poems by
local bards have been written on this theme.</p>

<p>On one of the most prominent of the South Down Hills, rising immediately
above the yew-tree valley, and called Bow Hill, are two large, and some
smaller tumuli, which are always called by the natives the graves of the
sea-kings, who with their followers are supposed to have fallen in a
battle fought under these very yew trees.</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me if the age of any of these trees has ever been
ascertained? Kingley Bottom, or, as people now-a-days prefer calling it,
Kingley Vale, is so much frequented as a spot for pic-nics and festive
days, that I have no doubt many of your readers have seen the trees to
which I refer, and can bear me out in asserting that they are worthy of
ranking, in age and beauty, with any of their species in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The "Hethel Thorn," so well known to many Norfolk people, is on a farm
now the property of that munificent patron of historical literature, Mr.
Hudson Gurney, by whom it was purchased from Sir Thomas Beevor. The
first Sir Thomas always said it was mentioned in a deed of 1200 and odd,
as a boundary, under the appellation of "the Old Thorn." It is stated,
also, that it is mentioned in some chronicle as <i>the thorn</i> round which
a meeting of insurgent peasantry was held during the reign of King John
(can any readers of
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"  give a reference to the precise
passage?). An etching of this interesting relic has been made by Mr.
Ninham. The involution of its branches, which are all hollow tubes, as
heavy as iron, is most curious; and although the tree is certainly
diminished of late years, it still puts out leaves and berries
vigorously.</p>

<span><i>Treatise against Equivocation</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 419.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
E<span class="smcap lowercase">UPATOR</span> has, in his examination of the
 MS. of this treatise, overlooked
a title prefixed by Garnet, which furnishes the heading by which the
book is correctly entered in the Catalogue of the Laudian MSS. as<i> A
Treatise</i> against (not <i>of</i> or <i>for</i>) <i>Lying and Fraudulent
Dissimulation</i>. "Of" was first written, but at once crossed out, and
"against" written <i>after</i> it, <i>not</i> interlined. Of the two errors which
E<span class="smcap lowercase">UPATOR</span> points out, the one was made at the press,
 by failure in reading
the contraction for "verbo," which is printed correctly at length at p. 43., and
the other was a mistake on the part of the transcriber.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Lycian Inscriptions</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 383.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As to the double language in
Homer of the gods and men, Heyne and others have thought (ad <i>Il.</i> &#913;. 403.)
that the one was the old language, the other the modern. See
Clarke ib., who thinks one was the learned name, the other the vulgar:
but gives a scholion of the former opinion. The passages are as follow:</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<p> <i>Il.</i> <span title="[Greek: Alpha]">&#913;</span> 403.</p>
<p> Gods. Briareus </p>
<p> Men. Ægæon.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p> <i>Il.</i>  <span title="[Greek: Beta]">&#914;</span> 813.</p>
 <p>Gods. Tomb of Myrine</p>
<p> Men. Batiea.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p>  <i>Il.</i>  <span title="[Greek: Xi]">&#926;</span> 291. </p>
<p> Gods. Chalcis</p>
<p> Men. Cymindis.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p>  <i>Il.</i>  <span title="[Greek: Upsilon]">&#933;</span>  74.</p>
<p> Gods. Xanthus</p>
<p> Men. Scamander.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>All these words, except one, are plain Greek,&mdash;and that one is a word of
men. It is impossible, therefore, that the gods' language could have
been the antiquated Greek language.</p>

<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i> (<span title="[Greek: Kappa]">&#922;</span> 305.) Mercury says that a certain plant is called
<i>Moly</i> by the gods, and that it is very difficult for men to find. The
answer to the question, What do men call it? therefore would probably
have been, that they have no name for it at all. It is an odd word, not
easy to derive, and ending in _u_; which Aristotle says
 is the ending of
only five words in Greek, and one of those, <span title="[Greek: asty]">&#7940;&#963;&#964;&#965;</span>, was
obsolete as an appellative in Aristotle's time.</p>

<p>Ichor, though applied in Homer to the gods, he does not say was a word
of the gods; and as it is used in Hippocrates, it is more probably a
dialectic than an antiquated word. Its termination, however is rare; and
in another instance, <span title="[Greek: tekmôr]">&#964;&#949;&#954;&#956;&#969;&#961;</span>, was obsolete in Aristotle's time
(<i>Rhet. init.</i>).</p>

<p>As to the Lycian language, the alphabet is said, in the appendix to
Fellows, to resemble partly the Greek, partly the Zend, and one or two
letters the Etruscan. The language is said (ib. 430.) to resemble the
Zend more than any other known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span> language; but to differ too much
to be considered as a dialect of Zend, and must rank as a separate
language.</p>

<p>I would observe, that one of the peculiarities mentioned, as compared
with all the Indo-Germanic languages&mdash;namely, the having no consonant at
the end of the masculine or feminine accusative&mdash;existed in the old
Latin, as in the Scipionic tombs, "optimo viro, omne Loucana."</p>

<p>&mdash;Your querist W. B. H. will perhaps
accept the following partial solution of his question, which has been
communicated to me by one of your own distinguished correspondents in
France. It is contained in a little volume published by Duellersan under
the following title, <i>Chansons Nationales et Populaires de France</i>,
Paris, 1846, 32mo:</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "Cette horrible chanson, la Carmagnole, est un monument
    curieux de la folie démagogique, et nous la donnons pour
    faire voir avec quelle poésie brutale on excitait le peuple.
    Elle eut une vogue en Août 1792, époque à laquelle Louis XVI.
    fut mis au Temple. Elle devint le signal et l'accompagnement
    des joies féroces et des exécutions sanglantes. On dansait la
    <i>Carmagnole</i> dans les bals; on la dansait au théâtre et
    autour de la guillotine. Barrère appelait les discours qu'il
    prononçait à la Convention, <i>des Carmagnoles</i>. L'air, qui est
    véritablement entrainant, était joué en pas redoublé dans la
    musique militaire; mais Bonaparte la défendit, ainsi que le
    <i>Ça-ira</i>, lors qu'il fut Consul.</p>

    <p class="blockquot">  "Cette chanson parut au moment où les troupes Françaises
    venaient d'entrer triomphantes dans la Savoie et le Piemont.

<p>&mdash;The late Admiral Frank
Sotheron, of Kirklington Hall, near Southwell, Notts, was, I have heard,
related to Wolfe, and possessed a portrait and several letters of his.
Admiral Sotheron died some ten years ago, but his daughter (and only
child) married the present member for Wilts, who afterwards took the
name of Sotheron.</p>

    <p class="right"> J. M. W.</p>

<p>I have a portrait of Wolfe in my possession, and, I believe, the
original from which the print, stated to be a scarce and contemporary
one, was taken, which furnishes the frontispiece to the second volume of
the <i>History of the Canadas</i>, by the author of <i>Hochelaga</i>. It fell,
singularly enough, into my hands a short time previous to the appearance
of the work in question, and I have been enabled since to trace its
possession by parties, and amongst them members of my own family, for a
very lengthened period. The artist I have not been able to discover; but
perhaps some possessor of the print, should the name appear, will afford
this information.</p>

 <p class="left"> (Great Yarmouth.)</p>

<p>As your pages have lately contained several communications on the
subject of General Wolfe, I send you the following story, which I heard
from a lady now deceased. Some time after Wolfe's death his family
wished to give some memorial of him to the lady who had been engaged to
him, and they consulted her as to the form which it should take. Her
answer was, "A diamond necklace;" and her reason, because she was going
to be married to another person, and such an ornament would be useful.
My informant, whose birth, according to the <i>Peerage</i>, was in 1766, had,
in her earlier days, often met this lady, and described her as showing
remains of beauty, but as no wiser than this anecdote would lead us to
suppose her.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Johannes Trithemius</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 442.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This noted historian and
divine was born at Trittenheim, in the electorate of Treves, in 1462. He
became abbot of Spanheim about 1482, where he made a rich collection of
manuscript and printed books. In 1506 he was appointed abbot of St.
James at Wurtzbourg. His writings are numerous, and there is an ample
collection of them in the British Museum. In his <i>Nepiachus</i> he gives an
account of his life and studies. He died at Wurtzbourg in 1516. The
learned and judicious Daunou thus characterises the volume <i>De
scriptoribus ecclesiasticis</i>: "Malgré beaucoup d'omissions et d'erreurs,
ce livre a été fort utile à ceux qui ont depuis mieux traité la même
matière; on le consulte encore aujourd'hui."</p>

<p>Leland, Bale, Pits, and Wharton, have recorded their obligations to
Trithemius. The venerable Leland quotes him frequently, under the name
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span> Trittemius, and styles him "homo diligentiæ plane maximæ nec
minoris lectionis."</p>

<p>It would appear that the work <i>Trithemii Collectanea de Scriptoribus

that "inter omnes ea eminet, quam Jo. Alberto Fabricio debemus." The
following remarks also respecting Trithemius appear in Walch's

    <p class="blockquot">"Incipit Trithemius a Clemente Romano; recenset scriptores
    970; ac testatur, se in opere hoc conficiendo per septem fere

not the first person who has suggested the identity of the objects; but,
as pointed out by Captain Smyth in a paper on Neptune, in the <i>United

fully 120° from the position assigned by Cacciatore to the star observed

<p>&mdash;Major General John Moyle, who died
in 1738, and was buried at Rushbrooke, near Bury St. Edmund's, was the
son of the Rev. John Moyle, of Wimborne Minster, co. Dorset, by Mary his
wife, daughter and coheir of Sir Giles Eyre, Kt., one of the Judges of
the Common Pleas. General Moyle, by his wife, who was Isabella daughter
of Sir Robert Davers, of Rushbrooke, Bart., had a family of five sons
and one daughter; the latter married Samuel Horsey, Bath king-at-arms.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Descendants of John of Gaunt</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 343.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A. B. may be right
as to there being "some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span> little confusion in Burke's excellent
work." There certainly is no "<i>little</i> confusion" in A. B.'s
communication.</p>

<p>Margaret Beaufort, successively Countess of Richmond and Derby, the
mother of King Henry VII., was the only child of John Beaufort, the
first Duke of Somerset.</p>

<p>What can A. B. mean by "Henry, Edmund, and John, successively dukes of
Somerset," to whom he conjectures Margaret Beaufort might have been
sister? There were not three brothers Beaufort successively <i>dukes</i> of
Somerset; nor were there ever three successive dukes of Somerset named
Henry, Edmund and John; though there certainly was a succession of John,
Edmund, and Henry, they being respectively father, uncle, and cousin of
Margaret.</p>

<p>John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset, who had been created Marquis of
Somerset and Dorset, was, on his death (1410), succeeded in the earldom
of Somerset by his eldest son, Henry Beaufort, who dying without issue
(1418), the second son, John Beaufort, succeeded to this earldom. He was
created <i>Duke</i> of Somerset (1443), and on his death without male issue
(1444), the dukedom became extinct; but the earldom of Somerset
descended to his brother, Edmund Beaufort, Marquis of Dorset (the third
son of John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset), who was afterwards (1448)
created Duke of Somerset. He was slain at the battle of St. Alban's
(1455), and was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Beaufort, who was
beheaded in 1463. He is said to have been succeeded by his next brother,
Edmund Beaufort; but it is doubtful if the fact were so, and the better
opinion seems to be that the dukedom became extinct by the attainder of
Duke Henry in 1463.</p>

<p>"The second and last Duke John," alluded to by A. B., is altogether a
myth: the last Beaufort Duke of Somerset was either Henry or Edmund; and
there was but one Duke John, and he was not the "second and last," but
the <i>first</i> duke.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Church of St. Bene't Fink</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 407.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I think some account
of the inscriptions, or of their having been transcribed, will be found
in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, as well as of those removed by the
destruction of the church of <i>St. Michael's, Crooked Lane</i>, in order to
make the approaches for new London Bridge; there, also, I think I have
seen some account of the inscriptions in the church pulled down for the
erection of the <i>Bank of England</i>. The preservation of the monumental
records of the dead has been so frequently suggested in
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" that I will not occupy space by urging further arguments in
favour of the scheme proposed for the transcription and preservation of
inscriptions on monuments and grave-stones. The numerous churches which,
in these days, are undergoing alterations and repairs, call for your
continued exertion to effect the object you have already submitted for
the purpose in former numbers. The ancient church of St. Mary, Lambeth,
has just been rebuilt, and many of the monumental tablets will of
necessity be removed from their former sites, and grave-stones may
disappear. The venerable <i>Ashmole</i> lies at the entrance of the old
vestry, under a flat stone; and outside, a short distance from the
window, lies <i>Tradescant</i>, under a large altar-tomb in a state of decay!</p>

 <p class="right"> G.</p>


<p>When the church of St. Bene't Fink was pulled down, to make room for the
new Royal Exchange in 1844, the monumental tablets, &amp;c. were removed to
the church of St. Peter's-le-Poor in Old Broad Street, to which Parish
the former is now annexed.</p>

<p>&mdash;I would refer your
correspondent, for the few particulars known of him, to Edwards's
<i>Anecdotes of Painting</i>, 1808 (in continuation of Horace Walpole's
<i>Anecdotes</i>), p. 120.</p>

<p>Cozens's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span> chief patrons were Wm. Beckford, Esq., of Fonthill; G. Baker,
of St. Paul's Churchyard; John Hawkins, Esq., of Bognor; and the Earl of
Harewood (of his time). If your correspondent wishes to see some few
fine specimens of his works, Mr. George Smith, of Hamilton Terrace, and
Charles Sackwille Bale, Esq., of Cambridge Terrace, possess some very
fine ones. Mr. J. Heywood Hawkins has at Bognor his father's collection.</p>

<p>Cozens's fine drawings are very uncommon, and he is now little known,
though one of the fathers of the Water-Colour School, and of the highest
ability. I am not aware of any published portrait of him: your
correspondent's portrait of him by Pine is therefore interesting. Pine
was Cozens's mother's brother.</p>

</h4>

<p>&mdash;In addition to what has
appeared in
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"  respecting
 the etymology of these terms, I send you a note of what Lingard says on the matter:</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "The celebrated party name <i>Tory</i> is derived from
    <i>toringhim</i>, to pursue for the sake of plunder. The name was
    given to certain parties in Ireland, who, refusing to submit
    to Cromwell, retired into bogs and fastnesses, formed bodies
    of armed men, supporting themselves and their followers by
    the depredations which they committed on the occupiers of
    their estates. They were called <i>Raperees</i> and <i>Tories</i>."</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "It was during the reign of Charles II. that the appellations
    of <i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i> became permanently affixed to the two
    great political parties.... The first had long been given to
    the Covenanters on the west of Scotland, and was supposed to
    convey a charge of seditious and anti-monarchical
    principles...."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Deep Well near Bansted Downs</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 315.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I am well
acquainted with the country immediately south of the Bansted Downs, and
can give W. S. G. some information about the wells there.</p>

<p>I know no country where there is so great a scarcity of water. The
nearest stream is a small branch of the Mole, which has its rise some
three miles off, just beyond Merstham (pronounced "Meestrum"). The ponds
are very few and shallow, so that the inhabitants have to rely on wells
for their water. Wells, however, are an expensive luxury, and appertain
only to the better-most dwellings. I know several labourers' cottages
distant upwards of a mile from the nearest well or pond; they use what
water they catch, and when that is gone, shift as they best can,&mdash;most
commonly do without. This scarcity of water may be the reason why a
district within fifteen miles of London is so thinly populated.</p>

<p>The country is very hilly, and even the valleys are some height above
the level of London. Woodmansterne is said to be the highest point in
Surrey next to Leith Hill.</p>

<p>Most of the farm-houses and superior cottages have wells, and many of
these are of considerable depth. There is one just at the foot of
Bansted Downs (and consequently in the valley), which is 120 feet deep.
After a dry summer this well is very low, and after a second quite
empty. This is about the general depth of the valley wells. There is one
in the railway valley, below Chipsted Church, some 100 feet deep; I have
never known it dry. Within a stone's throw of this last, the London and
Brighton railway runs in a very deep cutting,&mdash;I have been told the
deepest railway cutting in England,&mdash;and great fears were entertained
that this deep cutting would drain this and several neighbouring wells.
The only way, however, in which the railway affected the wells, was to
cut right through one, parts of which may still be seen in the
embankment.</p>

<p>It is not always the case that a deep well will drain its shallow
neighbours. At the Feathers Inn, at Merstham, is a well cut in the solid
chalk, 160 feet deep; this was quite out the other day, while two or
three wells not fifty yards off, each thirty feet deep, had plenty of
water.</p>

<p>Of course the wells on the hills are much deeper than those in the
valleys. At a farm called Wood Place, some three miles from Bansted, is
a well 365 feet deep; it is never actually out of water; four pair of
hands are needed to raise the bucket.</p>

<p>At a farm called Portnals, about a mile from Bansted, is the deepest
well I know in these parts; a horse is required to draw the water. It is
some 460 feet, and, I have been told, generally somewhat low. All these
wells are, I believe, in the chalk.</p>

<p>In this part of Surrey are some wells said to be 500, 600, or even 700
feet deep.</p>

<p>W. S. G. may find some resemblance between the above and the one he
wants, else there is no truth in a well.</p>

<p>I fear I am taking more of your space than my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span> subject merits. I
will therefore briefly conclude with a Query.</p>

<p>Where are the deepest wells in England?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Upton Court</i></span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 315.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;My friend Miss Mitford gives a most
interesting account of Upton Court in the <i>Ladies' Companion</i> for August
1850, which, as I know the place well, I believe to be perfectly
correct. A short extract may not be unwelcome:</p>

    <p class="blockquot">"Fifty years ago a Catholic priest was the sole inhabitant of
    this interesting mansion. His friend, the late Mrs. Lenoir,
    Christopher Smart's daughter, whose books, when taken up, one
    does not care to put down again, wrote some verses to the
    great oak. Her nieces, whom I am proud to call my friends,
    possess many reliques of that lovely Arabella Fermor of whom
    Pope, in the charming dedication to the most charming of his
    poems, said that 'the character of Belinda, as it was now
    managed, resembled her in nothing but beauty.'</p>

    <p class="blockquot">"Amongst these reliques are her rosary, and a portrait, taken
    when she was twelve or thirteen years of age. The face is
    most interesting: a high, broad forehead; dark eyes, richly
    fringed and deeply set; a straight nose, pouting lips, and a
    short chin finely rounded. The dress is dark and graceful,
    with a little white turned back about the neck and the loose
    sleeves. Altogether I never saw a more charming girlish
    portrait, with so much of present beauty and so true a
    promise of more,&mdash;of that order, too, high and intellectual,
    which great poets love. Her last surviving son died childless
    in 1769, and the estate passed into another family.</p>

    <p class="blockquot">"Yet another interest belongs to Upton; not indeed to the
    Court, but to the Rectory. Poor Blanco White wrote under that
    roof his first work, the well-known <i>Doblado's Letters</i>; and
    the late excellent rector, Mr. Bishop, in common with the no
    less excellent Lord Holland and Archbishop Whately, remained,
    through all that tried and alienated other hearts, his fast
    friend to his last hour."</p>

<p>The portrait of Arabella Fermor is in Reading, purchased at a sale at
Upton Court many years ago, when the property changed hands.</p>

<p>Of the value of broadsides, flying sheets, political squibs,
popular ballads, &amp;c. few can doubt; while the advantage of
having these snatches of popular literature, when collected,
deposited in some public and easily accessible library, will
be readily admitted by all who may have had occasion to
trespass on the time and attention (readily as they may be
afforded to parties entitled to claim them), of the Master
and Fellows of Magdalene, when requiring to consult the
matchless collection of ballads, penny merriments, and chap
books, deposited in their library by Samuel Pepys. These
remarks have been suggested to us by a very handsome quarto
volume entitled <i>Catalogue of Proclamations, Broadsides,
Ballads, and Poems presented to the Chetham Library</i>, by J.
O. Halliwell, Esq. As this catalogue is limited to one
hundred copies, and has been printed for private circulation
only, we must confine ourselves to announcing that it
contains an enumeration of upwards of three thousand
documents of the classes specified, many of them of very
considerable interest, which the zeal of Mr. Halliwell has
enabled him to gather together, and which his liberality has
led him to deposit in the Chetham Library. We have marked
several articles to which we propose to call the attention of
our readers at some future moment; and we have no doubt that
the Halliwell Collection in the Chetham Library, is one which
will hereafter be frequently referred to, and consulted by,
literary men.</p>

<p>If the Popular Mythology of these islands is ever to be fitly
recorded, its most important illustration will be found in
the writings of Grimm and his fellow-labourers. How zealously
they are pursuing their search after the scattered fragments
of the great mythological system which once prevailed in
Germany is shown by a new contribution to its history, which
has just been published by J. W. Wolf, under the title of
<i>Beiträge zur Deutschen Mythologie</i>: I. <i>Götter und
Göttinnen</i>. In this volume the reader will find not only much
that is new and interesting in connection with the history of
the great mythic heroes and heroines, but very valuable
supplements on the subject of Superstitions and Popular
Charms.</p>

<p>Mr. D'Alton, the author of <i>The History of Drogheda</i>, is
about to dispose of his Historical, Topographical, and
Genealogical MS. Collections. They occupy upwards of 200
volumes, and comprise, on the plan of Watt's <i>Bibliotheca</i>,
copious references to, and extracts from Records, Registries,
Pleadings, Wills, Funeral Monuments, and Manuscript
Pedigrees. They are to be sold wholly, or in lots, as
classified at the commencement of Mr. D'Alton's <i>Annals of
Boyle</i>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Ellis and Son, watchmakers, of Exeter, have published
a very interesting <i>Map showing the Time kept by Public
Clocks in various Towns in Great Britain</i>. Among many other
curious notes which may be made on this subject, we may
mention that it is Sunday in Inverness and Glasgow nearly
seventeen minutes earlier than at Plymouth; and it will be
1852 in Liverpool eleven minutes before it will be so in
Bristol.</p>

<p>Messrs. Cook and Hockin, of 289. Strand, have prepared a
cheap, but very complete Chemical Chest, to accompany

<p>Although for the sake of uniformity, it is called a Dictionary of
<i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> Geography, it will be in reality a Dictionary of
<i>Ancient</i> Geography, including even Scriptural Names. At present there
does not exist, either in the English or in the German languages, any
work on Ancient Geography sufficiently comprehensive and accurate to
satisfy the demands of modern scholarship. And yet there are few
subjects connected with antiquity for which we have such ample
materials. The discoveries of modern travellers, as well as the
researches of modern scholars, have, within the last few years, added
greatly to our knowledge of Ancient Geography; and it will be the aim of
the Editor to present, in the present work, the results of their labours
in this important branch of Classical Antiquity.</p>

<p>The work will, of course, not be confined to a barren description of the
geography of countries and of the sites of places; but it will also
include an account of the political history, both of countries and of
cities. An attempt will likewise be made to trace, as far as possible,
the history of the more important buildings of the cities, and to give
an account of their present condition, wherever they still exist.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">INDIA IN GREECE, or <span class="extended">TRUTH in MYTHOLOGY,</span> by E. POCOCKE, Esq. This work,
containing the earliest History of Greece drawn from original sources,
treats of the Colonization of that Country from North Western India; of
the Buddhistic Propaganda, the Tartarian Mission, and the Wars of the
Grand Lama in Hellas. Corresponding Maps of India and Greece, exhibit
the exact parent tribes and districts of the latter country&mdash;in Cashmir,
Thibet, Tartary, Afghanistan, and North Western India. This geographical
basis leads the way to a thorough revision of Early Hellenic History,
whereby the Cyclopes, Autochthones, Erectheus, Cecrops, Corybantes,
Cabeiri, and a long list of mythologic agents are at once placed in the
category of History. This work, equally adapted to the general reader
and the scholar, corroborates in the most interesting way the Scriptural
Accounts of the Hebrew Settlements of the Children of Israel in
Palestine, and demonstrates their wars with the Tartar and Rajpoot
tribes of that country.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
